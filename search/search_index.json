If you prefer detailed text instructions, continue reading below.</p> <p>Visualize which ligand-receptor pairs are likely to be present between cell-type pairs and the pathways in which they are involved. This is shown as a dot plot, available for each developmental age. By default, LR-pairs are on the y-axis and interactions are on the x-axis. The dot size represents the <code>S_inter</code> score and the color represents the <code>S_intra</code> score.</p> <p>All plots are interactive, allowing you to Zoom in, Zoom out and hover over each dot to see the source, target, and detailed information about the interaction.</p> <p>If there is no data available for a given cell-type pair, the plot will display an error message: Faceting variables must have at least one value.(see second image)</p> LR-pairs Plot Error / No Data <p>You can customize the plot:</p> <ul> <li>Cell-type and LR filters: Filter by <code>ligand-receptor</code>, <code>SOURCE class</code>, <code>TARGET class</code>, <code>pathway</code>, <code>Sending cell-type</code>, <code>Target cell-type</code>, <code>Ligand category</code>/<code>family</code>, and <code>Receptor category</code>/<code>family</code>.</li> <li>Plot settings: You can customize the x-axis, y-axis, faceting, dot size, and dot color based on different variables.</li> </ul> <p>Once you obtain the plot you are interested in, you can download the plot as SVG file using the download button in the top right corner of the plot (camera icon).</p>"}]}
